## 🔎 About the Project

*Justice For Families has been receiving calls from families asking for more reliable and up-to-date information about prisons. Having an aggregation of shared experiences can help inform and strengthen their internal community.*


🆙 We developed an Android and iOS community forum prototype application where users are able to post messages to a main feed that all users can view, like, and comment on. We added features specifically catered to Justice for Families' community, such as anonymous posting, tags to categorize posts, and urgent notifications.
